# Module Eleven Challenge: Express Note Taker

## Description
Using the starting (front-end) code provided, we must create a note taking application that uses Express routes and deployed the finished product to Heroku with no errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application:

WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```

## Mock-Up

The following is a preview of the final product:

![a gridlist of existing notes is present on the left hand side of the page. each note has a delete button. The right hand/majority of the page consists of a 'new note' entry where the user can fill in a title and body for their new note](./chall%2011%20pic%202.PNG)

The latest version of the webpage is active at:

## Installation

App is hosted on Heroku and can be used with no installation.

Running the app locally requires terminal commands `npm install` for dependencies and `npm start` (provided script) to get the server running. The user will see a console message that the app is listening at a particular port and the address at which the app can be reached
